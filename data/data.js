        <p>The page starts with the "Hero" section. We did discuss having the ability to have a video here which is still possible, though I did opt to mock this area up using news, similar to how the University of Oregon does. We can discuss this further during the session</p>
        
        <p>Below the hero, the homepage flows as expected. An introduction section is followed by a Recent Games area. Statistics follows this with an area for stat items laid over a photo. The page closes out with an area for a twitter feed and video highlights, which was something present on a both US's and Seton Prep's athletic homepage though it doesn't necessarily need to be here and this row (and any content really can be flexible)</p>
        
        <p>I'd also like to point out the site's main navigation bar. Fixed at the top of the page, I did <em>not</em> mock up the specifics for the dropdowns as I'd like to discuss the desired content and site map a bit further</p>`,
